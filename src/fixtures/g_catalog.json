Is it worth risking what may be less reliable hardware for an extra 2.5gig? I&#039;m not sure I trust these m.2 NICs, so having my intake occur across one has me a bit worried. At least with the other setup if the m.2 NIC fails I still have one 2.5gig NIC from the motherboard connected to the LAN and the server doesn&#039;t go dark.<br><br>- m.2 E-kay double 1 gig NIC ( https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/HINYSENO-Eth<wbr>ernet-Interface-Controller-HS-ME811<wbr>1A-2BT\/dp\/B0B1VB6QTJ )<br>- PCIe x1 slot double 2.5 gig NIC ( https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dual-Port-2-<wbr>5GBase-T-RTL8125B-Ethernet-Controll<wbr>er\/dp\/B0B4V6MPHD )","time":1677533714,"resto":91719411}],"last_modified":1677533714},{"no":91798524,"now":"02\/27\/23(Mon)14:45:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"we are actually talking to bots<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/efPrtcLdcdM","filename":"file","ext":".png","w":353,"h":195,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":138,"tim":1677527108794224,"time":1677527108,"md5":"tBOwmynK\/L\/w8otvj+XjJQ==","fsize":98500,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-are-actually-talking-to-bots","replies":1,"images":1,"last_replies":[{"no":91798636,"now":"02\/27\/23(Mon)14:51:22","name":"sage","com":"<a href=\"#p91798524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91798524<\/a>","filename":"079","ext":".png","w":475,"h":475,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1677527482658823,"time":1677527482,"md5":"H+fPgp9ApLWn3Cr8xXbriA==","fsize":125515,"resto":91798524}],"last_modified":1677527482},{"no":91797358,"now":"02\/27\/23(Mon)13:32:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"what new unreleased tech gizmos and gadgets are you waiting on to buyed and consoom?","filename":"1944336544","ext":".jpg","w":2400,"h":1756,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1677522747202186,"time":1677522747,"md5":"agetGDozfbODw9Z2y5rCXQ==","fsize":488799,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-new-unreleased-tech-gizmos-and-gadgets-are","replies":2,"images":0,"last_replies":[{"no":91798036,"now":"02\/27\/23(Mon)14:14:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p91797358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91797358<\/a><br>A VR set that makes me feel like a pilot.","time":1677525260,"resto":91797358},{"no":91798505,"now":"02\/27\/23(Mon)14:44:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p91798036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91798036<\/a><br>Good luck, PCVR died, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to come back for a bit.
