Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Monero&#039;s blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.<br><br>Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptocurrencies. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier to entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward gradually approached 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.<br><br>If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.<br><br>XMR Redpill: https:\/\/yewtu.be\/wq6w03E2DS4<br><br>XMR Stats: moneroj.net<br><br>USE Monero: https:\/\/cryptwerk.com\/pay-with\/xmr\/<wbr><br><br>OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.org<br><br>WHERE TO GET MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KYC:<\/span><br>Kraken<br>Binance<br>Bitfinex<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non KYC:<\/span><br>LocalMonero<br>Morphtoken<br>Bisq<br>Kucoin<br>Tradeogre<br>Crypto ATMs<br>see: kycnot.me<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mining<\/span><br>archive.is\/TWOah<br><br>HOW TO STORE MONERO?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Desktop<\/span><br>Official Gui\/Cli<br>Feather<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mobile<\/span><br>IOS: Cakewallet<br>Android: Monerujo","filename":"FpcIFaZX0AQ59kV","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1677374462634349,"time":1677374462,"md5":"yAIGBrzYGGnVzOXu+dgAyg==","fsize":279438,"resto":0,"id":"OGdjFzUk","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"xmr-monero-general","replies":136,"images":54,"omitted_posts":131,"omitted_images":53,"last_replies":[{"no":53876507,"now":"02\/27\/23(Mon)16:31:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p53874763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;53874763<\/a><br>This is a big issue.

Basically, the millennium club has gotten into bed with every single ve(3,3) dex. Each of these dexes, when going through genesis end up choosing projects that they believe will bring value to their system. When they identify the correct projects, they generally extend an early welcome to all MCLB dao members (basically anyone who holds any of their tokens). In addition to this, airdrops are given to these protocols. These airdrops start the flywheel on the dex. Each time these launch, MCLB is getting a huge allotment of governance tokens which they use to vote on their token pairs, which bring absurd APRs to the pairs. Those APRs fuel a frenzy of buying and selling on that dex, which brings fees for everyone who voted on that pair to receive emissions (which is MCLB, and any one else who wants to vote on it) MCLB then uses those fee rewards to bribe their pairs, which serves to gather even more votes, more fees, more APR. The magic is that these dexes are on something like 9 or 10 chains now, which insulates MCLB tokens from a singular chains price action. It also creates a feedback loop due to the IL experienced by LP providers. Each time the loop goes around again, the price of the token moves up another leg. This will continue as its a self sustaining system.","time":1677524090,"resto":53866164,"id":"vb5jXpYq"},{"no":53874593,"now":"02\/27\/23(Mon)13:55:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"There is also a new project joining the MCLB dao.
