My last cycle was 500 mg test e for 16 weeks with 50 mg var the last 8 weeks. I checked bp once a day on that cycle and highest I ever saw it get was 135\/82. The past 5ish days I\u2019ve been sitting at around 150-160\/85 consistently and it shot up to 177\/91 a couple days ago. <br>My first two cycles I never had any high e2 signs and when I got bloods done at week 6 on my last cycle it was within normal range, but to the high side, so I didn\u2019t take any ai the whole cycle and didn\u2019t plan to take any this cycle since I\u2019m doing the same test base, but just swapping out primo for the var. this cycle I\u2019ve had several possible high e2 symptoms though, holding a lot of water weight, skins kind of oily but not any real bad acne, been getting in a bitchy mood pretty easily, and high bp. So I took 12.5 aromasin 3 days ago and again today. Blood pressure had shot up to 172\/91 the day I took the ai, and it\u2019s back down to 140-150 systolic since 12 hours or so later. So I think high e2 could be the main culprit in the bp, and I\u2019m getting bloods done in 2 weeks so I\u2019ll verify the e2 levels then. <br>Should I add in cialis or something for the bp, or just stick 12.5 aramosin e3d and see if brings it back down closer to normal?
